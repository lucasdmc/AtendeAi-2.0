This document is SoT for the framework. It includes specialized architecture agents
without losing the consolidated flow. The orchestrator can include or skip ARCH states
based on repo needs (adaptive mode).

## Additional Agents
- api_architect: API-first governance (OpenAPI/GraphQL), versioning, compatibility.
- database_architect: DB modeling, migrations (reversible), performance & data contracts.

All other premises identical to 4.0.
